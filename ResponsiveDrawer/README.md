## Notes:

-   Tried to Copy the Reddit Drawer, but Couldn't for some issues
-   This Drawer is more complicated than it needs to be, cause there are 2 elements who are moving / performing action based on the Drawer State.
-   The wrapper mover element is for when in Larger Screen, to also resize the Main content container
-   The actual Drawer content wrapper, which is also moving, is for to be useful when in smaller screen, and if in future I can or someone else can change it to that of Reddit's.
    As this Forum is based on Reddit!
